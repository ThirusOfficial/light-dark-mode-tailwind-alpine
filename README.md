# Light & Dark mode toggle with Tailwind CSS & Alpine JS

This demo uses Tailwind CSS and Alpine JS to give an option to the user to switch between light and dark mode. This also includes the feature to "remember" the user's choice in the browser for the current session.

## Getting Started

```
npm install
npm run build
```

Note: The build script uses Tailwind CSS 'JIT' mode, watches the changes in HTML and builds the styles on the go.
